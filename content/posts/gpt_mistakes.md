Wanted to share a new prompt I've been using a lot with ChatGPT. It's basically, "What are common mistakes people make when doing X". I like it since it's an easy way to double check yourself on certain things before diving in.

I've asked this for things like buying an insurance policy, cooking a new dish, doing some work around my house. Most of the time it doesn't necessarily give me anything I don't already know, but here and there I find it saved me. 

I like this framing because of the disconfirmatory angle(finding things not to do), rather than a confirmatory one(asking it what you should do)

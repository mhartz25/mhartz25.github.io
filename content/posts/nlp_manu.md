I had my first research paper published surrounding a lot of the work I have been doing at NeuroFlow. This was a new experience to me, and one that I learned a lot doing.  Not only was this my first foray into any sort of research writing but I was also entrusted to be first author – an honor I would not have been able to handle if not for the endless support of everyone else involved.

One thing I did not appreciate was just how much re-writing this process would take. We ended up applying to a journal with a pretty strict word and citation limit so much of the paper’s content had to be streamlined. I think there is a lot to be excited about in seeing how technology can be used to change the landscape of care.

This is part one in hopefully a, multipart, blog series I’m working on titled How to Analyze Data, where the goal is to give people the foundational knowledge and tools necessary to start thinking about data critically. Every single person reading this looks at data in some form throughout every day of their lives. In most cases it’s very trivial or inconsequential. Sometimes it’s both. But one area we can all use help on is in times when things aren’t trivial and things aren’t inconsequential. Suddenly our ability to navigate those situations can become important. And hopefully through these series of posts I can help to strengthen each person’s ability to fend for themselves. Here is my disclaimer now to say I am not perfect, but it’s likely I have thought about this topic much longer than you have and I think I’ve been able to develop a good sense of what works and what doesn’t. You don’t have to, nor should you take everything I say as fact. But if you can come away from this series with one new way to think about data and one way in which you think I’m dead wrong then I will have succeeded as an author. Now without further ado… 


Everyone has their favorite data points to look at…err, people on the Data Science team might have our favorite data points to look at, but at some point even we tire of seeing the same metrics over and over. Data can be informative, but it can also be bland. That’s good right? Boring data = Good Data? If your heart rate spikes when looking at the latest Engagement dashboard,  it’s either because something went very wrong, your body isn’t a fan of the spicy food you fed it for lunch, or maybe a mixture of the two. But we can say with some strong certainty that it won’t be because the data inspired you or because the data just helped you stumble on an insight that will lead to the Next Big Thing™. Let’s face it data is boring and always will be.


But wait, you say surely no blog post titled “How to Analyze Data: Lesson 1” could ever take this pessimistic of an outlook on data. You’re goddamn right! Data can be inspiring! It can make you better at your job. It can help your hair grow back! Maybe not that last one, but the point stands. Data is useful and if you know how to utilize it it can make you much more effective. 
It’s important to remember you have all the knowledge you will need to think about data. You already apply these skills in so many other parts of your life, yet oftentimes people start to see numbers and get a little spooked. They stop thinking for themselves and start taking everything at face-value. Research says people are 22% more likely to believe misinformation when there are numbers attached to it. Point being you should never take anything at face value. Especially, made up statistics about how people are more likely to believe things when there are numbers attached to it.

But to become a Data Grand Master we must first start with the building blocks of all data. This brings us to Lesson #1: Numerators and Denominators. Hopefully we all remember fractions; Numerators are the numbers on the top, While Denominators are on the bottom. Identifying Numerators and Denominators in the data can start to demystify a lot of metrics we use here at NeuroFlow and abroad. 

The reason Numerators and Denominators can help us is because they force us to understand exactly what is being shown. Rather than generally accepting whatever data point is hitting your frontal cortex at a given moment, going through the exercise of identifying Numerators and Denominators will force our brain to engage with what we are being shown[1]. And from that we may start to develop questions: How was this number constructed? Who is included in the population? What is the time frame being shown? As we start mapping the data to the Numerator or Denominator and forming questions, we might identify areas in which the data is not clear. And from there we have the jumping off point to a deeper conversation, which we will iterate on until both parties' understanding of the data has been elevated.

Numerators and Denominators essentially boil each data point down to “What is being measured” and “Who or What did it happen to”. The answers to those questions should always be very clear, and when they’re not you should have alarm bells going off in your head. You shouldn’t have to guess what sort of criteria is being used to establish a population.


As an example, let’s think about the Unemployment Rate in the US. What is the Numerator and what is the Denominator? Take a second to test yourself before 

![FRED Unemployment Chart](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=G2pH&nsh=1&width=600&height=400&trc=1)

The Numerator is simple enough, how many people currently don’t have a job. But the Denominator is actually a little tricky. The Denominator is not the entire population of the US, it’s a much less clear number, the Civilian Labor Force. Who exactly is included in the Civilian Labor Force? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the Civilian Labor Force is defined as including, “all people aged 16 and older…who are either working or actively looking for work”[2].

Using our framework of Numerators and Denominators should allow us to keep metric definitions front of mind and follow them until we understand what’s going on. If the phrase ‘actively looking for work’ is still unclear then we can find out what that means. And so forth. The more active we are in our search for truth the better off we’ll be in finding it. And that will enable us to think about the implications of the data metrics at a higher level. If the denominator is people looking for work, is that a consistent number over time? If people are dropping out of the Labor Force because they’re not finding work, that can be a very important signal about the strength of the Labor Market. These are the sort of second order effects it can be helpful to be aware of, and mapping to Numerators and Denominators can help us get there.

Another area in which Numerators and Denominators can help us is with comparing unlike groups. We like to make comparisons to help us understand differences but sometimes it’s not always easy. There are places in which we do this every day that are second nature to us. We’re unlikely to compare gas tank capacity between a Toyota Prius and a Ford F-150, instead we’ll use Miles per Gallon. At the grocery store we don’t get charged per Apple, we get charged per pound. Both Miles per Gallon and Price per Pound are ways to adjust for differences while still allowing us to easily make comparisons.


It’s worth pointing out that this is an area that is often manipulated. Denominators are not always clear and can be weaponized to make the data adhere to a certain narrative. Sometimes you might have no choice but to compare two different groups, and that is fine. But, whoever the data author is needs to be sure to draw attention to this in order to reduce confusion. If it’s unclear what population someone is pulling a metric from or if their methods seem hidden then we may want to take what they’re saying with a grain of salt. We always want to be aware of the Denominator and how that affects the overall metric.  Is the population size of our data getting bigger, smaller, or staying the same? What are the implications of that? These are questions that should run through your head any time you are presented with data. 

In a way, this tool is just teaching you to be 4 again. Any chart or data point you see should be met with a barrage of Whys, Whos, and any other interrogative pronoun that exists. Mapping the data to Numerators and Denominators in your head is a way to begin to think through this data and lead you to any questions you might have. This sort of mental model is just a single tool that can lead you to better data analysis, but it’s a powerful one. And what I consider to be foundational to progressing to becoming an effective data practitioner.


This is the end of lesson 1. If you have any feedback, please reach out. I want to know if this was helpful in any way or if it was just pedantic rambling. I’ll also put a few exercises below if anyone wants to try to try out a few examples

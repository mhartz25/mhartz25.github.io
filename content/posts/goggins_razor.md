David Goggins is the type of figure who I definitely would have hated 5 years ago if I had come across him. And I think that probably says more about what my mindset was than who he is(1). I would’ve seen him as some type of motivational grifter who would say anything to get people to buy what he is selling. And perhaps that might be true. But I don’t think it matters. I’ve come to the conclusion that, whether or not something what he says is true, there is value in believing it.

And there’s other aspects of this in my life that I’ve slowly shifted my views on – such as the role of Luck and hard-work in success -- that I now think of this concept as Goggin’s Razor. 

I think there is a lot of benefit to be had in believing Goggin’s message on the surface and that is all that really matters. Can I think my way into being an ultramarathoner? Probably not[1]. Can I do my best to push myself beyond whatever limits I’ve self-imposed on myself? Absolutely. If believing Goggins message can get you off the couch and running 5 miles a day then I say go for it. 

In some ways Goggin’s Razor is just Pascal’s Wager defined in a secular manner. That might be fair, but I tend to think of Pascal’s Wager as more of a framing for asymmetric bets, where Goggin’s Razor might be more a way to influence one’s attitude or interpret life. 

Like any good maxim or heuristic there are obvious dangers if you take it to its logical extreme. But taking it on its surface has its benefits. Don’t go crazy applying this to every conspiracy or whatever pseudo-science drivel you might come across on social media. 

Confucius got it right a long time ago: “The Man who says he can, and the man who says he can not.. Are both correct”

In all of these discussions, people readily admit that their use of social media is too high, but we usually disagree on where the right amount of use lies.</p><p>I, myself, have to admit that I’ve started to become a bit of a digital ascetic; at least an aspiring one. I feel like I have good reason, but one thing I’ve realized is I am not great at making my arguments, hence my reason for trying to write this essay.</p><h3 id=being-heads-up>Being Heads Up</h3><p>One thing I’ve realized is I think I’m crafting my argument in the wrong direction. Rather than try to explain what I might get back with the added time if I were to reduce my screen time by some amount, I realize it might be better to try to start from the expression of my values and see where in that the optimal amount of social media use ends up.</p><p>I am becoming more and more sure that the single greatest use of my time is spending it engaging with the people I love. I use the word engaging very deliberately. There are different levels of engagement, and I’d argue that the higher up you go the more rewarding it is. But I think something that is crucial is allowing the natural ebbs and flows of a conversion take place. Think of it like surfing and looking for the right wave to ride. You might try a few, but the whole time you’re waiting for the big one to arrive. And when it does you fully commit.</p><p>Phones disrupt that. There’s a part of you that isn’t fully engaged. Rather than being in the ocean ready for the wave to appear, you’re standing on the shore. By the time you see the wave it’s too late to get out there, the moment has passed. Passively staring at a phone – not being engaged with those around you – suffocates any conversation before it can happen.</p><h3 id=active-not-passive>Active, not Passive</h3><p>Another thing that is super important to me is spending time thinking. Usually this takes the form of reading. I love to spend time lost in a book, whether it be fiction or nonfiction. I love to learn and this is by far the best way I do it.</p><p>One thing that is tough for me to reconcile with is the ability for me to surface good content online. With so much information out there it is hard for me to completely turn my back on social media. I think the biggest thing that has helped me is trying to have a plan before I open my computer. Taking an active role in what I am doing, as opposed to just hopping onto Twitter and letting my brain be bombarded by whatever The Algorithm decides to throw at me.</p><p>There are certain people I make sure to check in with – people who write a lot or consistently share things I found worthwhile. I use an RSS feed as a way to have a more personally curated timeline.</p><p>The internet is definitely a double-edged sword, so finding ways to protect myself from being cut is important. Even if it means limiting some of the upside available to me. I try to take a Via Negativa approach. Ripping things out and seeing if I’m still getting what I want out of what’s left. So far I think it’s working, but I can probably find some more things to eliminate.</p><p>Two heuristics: When in doubt, opt for the long-form content. And be as active as possible in how you consume it</p><h3 id=why-do-we-fall>Why Do We Fall</h3><p>I am very far from perfect in the scenarios I’ve laid out above. But that is who I hope to be. My sister often tells me I’m being self-righteous or dismissive of other people’s opinions(she’s right). I recognize my own faults but all too often I am myopic to others’. The best excuse I can give myself is that I’m human. In East of Eden the concept of Timshel is discussed – the idea that humans can and will sin, but it’s in their efforts to overcome these fallibilities that makes us who we are(2). I won’t ever be perfect in this venture but I can definitely try.</p><p>More and more I have found how easy it is to be sucked back into the world of Social Media. I can be diligent 95% of the time but if I falter one day then that next day becomes that much harder. The best solution I’ve found so far is to just have my phone on me as little as possible and to just keep stacking good days.</p><h3 id=footnotes>Footnotes</h3><p>1)I’ll use social media as a catchall for most of my technology discussion the rest of the way
2) I write very briefly about East of Eden here, but I can’t recommend it more.</p><h4 id=postscript>Postscript</h4><p>The title is a reference to the work Cal Newport has done. The last 20 minutes or so of a Tim Ferriss podcast is on does a great job of explaining the concept of Digital Minimalism</p></div></div></div></div></div><section id=comments><div class="py-3 content"><div class=container><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-8"><div class=comments><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo issue-term=pathname label=comment theme=github-light crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></div></div></div></div></section><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.2.0/highlight.min.js integrity="sha512-TDKKr+IvoqZnPzc3l35hdjpHD0m+b2EC2SrLEgKDRWpxf2rFCxemkgvJ5kfU48ip+Y+m2XVKyOCD85ybtlZDmw==" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.2.0/languages/r.min.js defer></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.2.0/languages/python.min.js defer></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.2.0/languages/stan.min.js defer></script><script>window.addEventListener("load",function(){hljs.initHighlighting()},!0)</script></body></html>
